## []{#53}6.2.1. Timer events

Timer events are created with the `timer` command. The timer event
occurs when the designated time has elapsed, starting from the time at
which the `timer` statement was executed. Further execution continues
starting with the target label specified by the `timer` command.

Timer events (like all events) can only occur during the execution of a
`wait` command.
